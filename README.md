- 👋 Hi, I’m @n00b0dyy
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in mom of my friend Tom.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the delicate craft of knitting sweaters for garden gnomes, because everyone deserves to stay cozy, even mythical creatures.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on figuring out how to train my cat to make coffee in the morning.
- 📫 How to reach me?  Send a message in a bottle, but make sure it's sealed tight – I wouldn't want my inbox flooded with seawater
- 😄 Pronouns: Toast/Sandwich
- ⚡ Fun fact: Penguins make sounds that can be called "singing." However, if you try to ask them for the lyrics, they are completely clueless.
