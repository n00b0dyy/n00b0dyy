ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @n00b0dyy
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and both high- and low-level programming.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my expertise in digital security protocols and AI-driven analysis, while also exploring programming languages from assembly to Python.
ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge convention in tech, especially in secure system architecture or cryptographic development.
ðŸ“« How to reach me? Letâ€™s keep it old school â€“ a well-encrypted email is always welcome.
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
âš¡ Fun fact: Penguins make sounds that could be described as "singing." However, if you ask them for the lyrics, theyâ€™ll remain mysteriously tight-beaked.
